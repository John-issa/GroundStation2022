Labview software for McGill Rocket Team. To be used for the competition at SpacePort America Cup 2022.
You need to have labview, and LabJack LJM installed on your computer for this software to work, both of which are free.
All files must be downloaded for the program to run properly. In reality you probably only need half of these files but
I don't feel like figuring out all of the dependencies. 

A few notes on using the software:
  Always double check your startup configuration
  To restart the program, don't just press 'exit' or 'stop'. You have to close the entire labview application
    otherwise many of the parameters and data will remain in memeory.
